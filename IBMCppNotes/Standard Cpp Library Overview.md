The C++ class is an extension of the C language structure. Because the only difference between a structure and a class is that structure members have public access by default and class members have private access by default, you can use the keywords class or struct to define equivalent classes.

For example, in the following code fragment, the class X is equivalent to the structure Y:

CCNX10C
```cpp
class X {

  // private by default
  int a;
```
The Standard C++ Library is supplied by IBM, and this manual is based on the Dinkum C++ Library and the Dinkum C++ Library Reference.

Use of this Dinkum C++ Library Reference is subject to limitations. See the Dinkumware Notices and the IBM Notices for detailed restrictions. Also, see the specific copyright notice at the bottom of this page.

A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from the Dinkum C++ Library, a conforming implementation of the Standard C++ Library. These functions perform essential services such as input and output. They also provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations. Numerous function and class definitions accompany these functions to help you to make better use of the library. Most of the information about the Standard C++ Library can be found in the descriptions of the C++ library headers that declare or define library entities for the program. The C++ library headers have two broader subdivisions, iostreams headers and STL headers.

The Standard C++ Library works in conjunction with the headers from the Standard C Library. For information about the Standard C Library, refer to the documentation that is supplied with the operating system.

A few special conventions are introduced into this document specifically for this particular implementation of the Standard C++ Library. Not all implementations support all the features described here. Hence, this implementation introduces macros, or alternative declarations, where necessary to provide reasonable substitutes for the capabilities required by the C++ Standard.

The Standard C++ Library is based on the C++03 standard and has not been updated to C++0x. The C++0x library functions will be updated in a future release.

public:

  // public member function
  int f() { return a = 5; };
};

struct Y {

  // public by default
  int f() { return a = 5; };

private:

  // private data member
  int a;
};
```
If you define a structure and then declare an object of that structure using the keyword class, the members of the object are still public by default. In the following example, main() has access to the members of obj_X even though obj_X has been declared using an elaborated type specifier that uses the class key class:

CCNX10D
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct X {
 int a;
 int b;
};

class X obj_X;

int main() {
  obj_X.a = 0;
  obj_X.b = 1;
  cout << "Here are a and b: " << obj_X.a << " " << obj_X.b << endl;
}
```
See the output of the above example:
Here are a and b: 0 1
